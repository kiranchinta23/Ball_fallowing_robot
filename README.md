# Ball_fallowing_robot


To run, setup two terminals
1. cd catkin_ws
2. catkin_make
3. source devel/setup.bash

Run in separate terminals: 
1. roslaunch my_robot world.launch
2. roslaunch ball_chaser ball_chaser.launch  

The bot will follow the white ball around. You have to manually move the white ball to places that the bot can see it.
